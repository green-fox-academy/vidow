/*
 * Create a function that takes two arrays of characters and a number.
 * It should replace the contents of the first array from the given index
 * with the contents of the second array.
 * The function should return a number which tells whether it was successful:
 *    * If all is right it should return 0.
 *    * If the index is out of bounds it should return -1.
 *    * If the inserted content would be longer than the receiving array it should return 1 and leave the array as it is.
 * IMPORTANT: Think about what kind of arguments You need to make this happen and craft the function accordingly.
 *
 * Write code in the main function to test all scenarios and write out the result You need to check whether this works.
